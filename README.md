# Blog-Cells Demo

This demo shows an example of how to use the [Blog-Cells](https://github.com/rameshvarun/blog-cells#blog-cells) package to add interactive and runnable code cells to a [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/install/) blog post. The blog posts are written in `.html.erb` files but they might as well be written in `.md` or .`html` files and it would still work the same. The Blog-Cells scripts are added to the post pages using the `script` tag.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the following command to install the Middleman if you don't have it already:

```bash
gem install middleman
```

## Usage

You can run the demo by running the following command:

```bash
middleman server
```

The site should be available on `http://localhost:4567/`.
